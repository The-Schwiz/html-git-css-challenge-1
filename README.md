# HTML-GIT-CSS-CHALLENGE-1

## Description

This was a refactoring project for bootcamp to improve the code quality and readability of the html and CSS files for Horiseon SEO. 

I learned how to consolidate css elements and ensure I use semantic HTML elements correctly.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
